title: "Fedora 30 Customization"
excerpt: "A script I use to customize my Fedora 30 environment"

This is pretty much the same script as my [Ubuntu](https://blog.ricosharp.com/posts/2019/Ubuntu-Customization) one, minus VLC player. Actually, as I write this I've completly forgotten to include Jekyll! I'll sort that out another day. 

This script is intended to be run under Fedora 30. It isn't my current desktop environment as I have had a lot of issues with GNS3 under it. But I thought I would update it anyway.
